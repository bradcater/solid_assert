# solid_assert

solid_assert is a simple implementation of an `assert` utility in Ruby. 

It let you code in your assumptions when coding. Sometimes, when you are coding, you have this thinking of "I it reaches here, then this variable has to be this value", or "This line should never be executed", or "At this point, this list should contain an entry for all the keys in this hash". These are the kind of scenarios when assertions comes handy.

The practice of using assertions makes your code more solid, since it is the computer who systematically verifies your code integrity. 

# Installation

In your `Gemfile`

	gem "solid_assert"
